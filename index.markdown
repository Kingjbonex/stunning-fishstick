## Who we are

We fight the Bigs (Pharma, Oil,  Govt, Finance, and Refrigerators) investing in alternative investments using AI propensity model developed by Crowdstrike architect.
We are backed by a regional bank, UMB. We are supported by Polish developers.  And through a partnership with Corteva, we implement a sales and product strategy with a grassroots effort to connect with farmers throughout Iowa/Minnesota/South Dakota, and beyond.
